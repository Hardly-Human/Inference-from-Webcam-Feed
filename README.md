# Inference-from-Webcam-Feed
A Neural network drawing Inference from real-time webcam feed. 

- This Project Involves capturing Images from live webcam feed and training them on a MobileNet model implemented in __TensorflowJS__.
- A DNN is added at the bottom layers of MobileNet model to perform __Transfer Learning__ inorder to implement _multi-class classification_ with Rock,paper and scissors data. 
- This project uses a __webcam.js__ file Open-sourced by __GOOGLE__ to simplify the operations handling webcam feed from browsers.
